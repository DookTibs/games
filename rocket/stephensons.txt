1 board
7 locomotives (7 colors)
128 share cards
60 track tiles
28 stations (4 colors)
45 tokens (5 types) figure out goods distrbution (each cty gets 3 for instance, but which?) - an image on BGG will help
100 bank notes

-- THOUGHTS --
1. skip bank notes
2. crayon rail?
3. just do it as ipad! all public knowledge; see http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
4. skip tiles and just use a generic circular marker (poker chip, etc.) to mark track - also handles
	problem of sizing board and hex tiles!

German Railways trains: blue, orange, brown, black, yellow, red, purple, green
Macao: lots of cubes
Power Grid: lots of houses: blue, purple, green, yellow, red, black
Taj: palaces in blue, red, light tan, dark tan,  grey

CHEAPEST POSSIBLE WAy TO PROTOTYPE
1. no box
	2. print board on four sheets of paper, tape together
3. use slips of paper with company names (sleeved even) for shares
4. use 60 tiddlywinks (maybe ownership discs from AoS, maybe poker chips from Wits & Wagers) for track
5. use locos from German Railways (orange, brown, black, yellow, red, green, purple) as locos
6. use palaces from Taj (blue, light tan, dark tan, grey)
	7. use cubes for goods tokens: colored to match good type, with some kind of marking to indicate city of origin (sticker?)
8. use chips for money

trains, palaces, flattish discs, cubes


(
5. use locos from German Railways (blue, orange, brown, black, yellow, red, green) as locos
6. use cubes from Santiago (white, purple, grey, natural) as stations
